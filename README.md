# Airfisher's Torn Script Library

## Torn Race Checker

Torn Race Checker adds a convenient race status display to your Torn sidebar that shows your current racing status at a glance.

- 📊 Displays real-time race status: "Ready!", "Waiting", or "In Race"

- 🎨 Color-coded indicators

- 👆 Click the "Ready!" status to instantly go to the racing page

- 🔄 Automatically updates as your race status changes

- ✅ Works great with the popular "Torn: Show Timers" script without any conflicts

| Default                            |      With "Torn: Show Timers"      |
